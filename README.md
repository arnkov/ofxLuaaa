# ofxLuaaa
Write Lua bindings for your openFrameworks classes.
This addon doesn't provide finished bindings to oF. It's just a way to write some for your classes.
For more info about how luaaa.hpp works have a look at https://github.com/gengyong/luaaa.
For something with more functionality check out ofxLua.
